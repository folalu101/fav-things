    <h2><strong>Who is an ideal father?</strong></h2>
    <p><em>The ideal father is someone who puts family before work, encourages his kids for the smallest reason that make the child happy like making a project in class for example, and he is also someone that can always be relied on. For a father, when it comes to work and family, family should always come first.An ideal parent believes in being a positive role model for their children. Children learn through observation and mimic the behavior of their parents. Parents who can work out their conflicts and disagreements through calm discussions rather than heated arguments become healthy role models and, thus, ideal parents.</em></p>
