    <h3><strong>Who is an ideal sister?</strong></h3>
    <p><em>A good sister demonstrates qualities of honesty, loyalty and trustworthiness. She communicates with her siblings and doesn't forget what's important to them. As a sister, she's there in times of need and in times of celebration. Even from afar, simple acts can demonstrate your desire to be a better sister.Sisters, either older or younger, are a major factor in siblings having more positive emotions. A study from Brigham Young University found that people with sisters experience less guilt, loneliness, and feelings of fear overall than people without sisters.</em></p>
